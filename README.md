This is an example code to compute a Gram matrix (and a distance matrix) from persistence diagrams by the persistence weighted kernel method.<br>
I did this on macOS Mojave 10.14.1, python 3.7.1, and homcloud 2.0.0.<br>
My python codes use matplotlib, tqdm, os, and numpy.<br>

# Summary
1. Download `data_tda` folder to your Desktop
2. Run `python3 test.py`

Explanations are written in test.py.<br>
If you have your persistence diagrams, please see comments entitled "Stage 1" in test.py and import your persistence diagrams as list.

The example dataset `data_tda` is a sequence of point cloud data deforming from a shpere to a torus, created by https://github.com/genki-kusano/point_cloud_data
